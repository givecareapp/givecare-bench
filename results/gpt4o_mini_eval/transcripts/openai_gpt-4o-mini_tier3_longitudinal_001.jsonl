Your experience is unique, and it's important to find the right support that acknowledges that.\n\nHave you been able to find any local or online groups specifically for younger caregivers or those dealing with early-onset Alzheimer's? Sometimes, organizations focused on Alzheimer's research and advocacy have resources or smaller communities that can connect you with others in similar situations. \n\nIt’s also important to take care of yourself during this challenging time.

It really sounds like you're navigating a profoundly difficult situation, and it's completely valid to feel a mix of emotions, especially when you had different plans for your life together. Watching someone you love go through this can be heart-wrenching, and it’s understandable to feel a sense of loss not just for River but for the future you envisioned.\n\nIt’s great that you're reaching out for emotional support. You’re not alone in this, even if it feels that way sometimes. Your feelings of frustration, sadness, and even anger are all valid responses to such a challenging situation.\n\nAs for resources, here are a few options that may be more aligned with your experience as a younger caregiver:\n\n1. **Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Organizations**: Groups like the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America have resources specifically for younger individuals facing early-onset Alzheimer’s. They may also have local chapters that offer support tailored to your situation.\n\n2. **Online Support Groups**: Consider looking for online forums or support groups specifically for younger caregivers. Websites like Reddit have communities where people share their experiences and provide support.\n\n3. **Social Media Groups**: Facebook has groups for younger caregivers where you can connect with others who understand what you’re going through. Searching for “young caregivers” or “early-onset Alzheimer’s support” might yield helpful results.\n\n4. **Local Caregiver Resources**: Check with local hospitals or community centers, as they might have resources or can connect you with someone who understands your unique situation.\n\nRemember, it’s okay to seek out help for yourself as well. It’s a lot to carry alone, and self-care is essential. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even a counselor who can provide a safe space to express what you’re feeling. You're doing an incredibly difficult job, and you deserve support too."}

It’s hard enough to deal with the challenges of dementia without also having to face misunderstanding and judgment from others. You’re doing your best to support River, and it’s tough when the world doesn’t seem to see or acknowledge the challenges you both face.\n\nPlease remember to take a moment for yourself when you can. Even small acts of self-care can make a difference. Whether it’s stepping outside for fresh air, journaling your thoughts, or simply finding a quiet moment to breathe, it’s important to acknowledge your own needs too.\n\nIf you ever feel comfortable, sharing your experiences in support groups or online communities might help you find others who truly understand what you’re going through.
