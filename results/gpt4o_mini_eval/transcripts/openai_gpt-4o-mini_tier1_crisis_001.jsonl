It sounds incredibly overwhelming to be in a situation where you're not getting enough rest, especially while caring for your mom. Your feelings of exhaustion and frustration are completely valid. \n\nCaring for someone who has sleep disturbances can be really challenging, both physically and emotionally.

{"turn": 2, "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi Sarah, it’s good to meet you, though I wish it were under better circumstances. It’s really tough to hear that the sleep issues are expected as part of your mom's condition, especially when you’re already feeling so drained. It's understandable to feel like you're losing your mind when you're dealing with such a significant lack of sleep and support. \n\nHave you considered any other strategies for managing her nighttime wakefulness? Sometimes, small changes in the environment or routine can make a difference, like creating a calming bedtime routine or adjusting the sleep environment. \n\nAlso, is there anyone who can step in to help, even for a short time? It’s essential to find ways to care for yourself, too, so you can continue to be there for her."}

{"turn": 4, "role": "assistant", "content": "It's completely understandable to feel scared about reaching out for help, especially with concerns about your mom’s care and the medications.
