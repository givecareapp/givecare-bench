It’s completely understandable to feel stressed when you’re trying to meet the needs of your son and your mother while also managing your work responsibilities. \n\nGiven how critical the IEP meeting is for your son’s education, and the importance of your mother’s physical therapy, it might be worth having a candid conversation with your boss about your situation. You could explain the significance of these appointments and see if there’s any flexibility for you to adjust your work schedule on that day. Sometimes, just having an honest dialogue can lead to understanding and support.\n\nIf you feel it’s possible, you might also explore if there’s someone who can help with your mother’s appointments, even if just for this one day, so you can be present at the IEP meeting.\n\nYou’re clearly trying to do what’s best for your family, and it’s important to remember that it’s okay to ask for support when you need it.

If your brother isn’t able to help, that’s disappointing, and it’s okay to express that frustration. You deserve support, and it’s not fair that he’s placed the burden solely on you.\n\nSince your husband is away and your brother isn’t able to assist, have you considered reaching out to friends, neighbors, or community resources that might be able to help with your mother’s physical therapy?

You’re doing the best you can under extremely challenging circumstances, and it’s okay to set boundaries for yourself. If possible, try to carve out even small moments away from caregiving to recharge, whether that’s a quiet time in another room or a short walk outside.\n\nIf you haven’t already, consider reaching out to a support group for caregivers. Connecting with others who are in similar situations can be incredibly validating and provide you with coping strategies.

Some groups also offer virtual options, which could make it easier to participate without needing to travel.\n\nAnother option might be to look for ways to integrate self-care into your daily routine, even in small ways. For example, could you set aside just 10-15 minutes during your son’s homework time to step outside for a breath of fresh air or enjoy a quiet moment? \n\nIt’s also worth considering if there are any resources available in your community that could help with your mother’s care or your son’s routine, even if just temporarily. Sometimes local organizations or volunteers can provide support for specific needs, which might free up a little time for you.\n\nYou’re doing an incredible job with everything you’re managing, and seeking out even small moments for yourself is important.
