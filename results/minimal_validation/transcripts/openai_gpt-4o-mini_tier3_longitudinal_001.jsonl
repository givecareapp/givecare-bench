Remember, it’s okay to lean on others and seek support as you navigate this journey.\n\nIf you ever need to talk again or if there’s anything else I can do for you, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself as you work on the memory book and honor your experiences with River. You’re doing your best in a difficult situation, and that’s something to be proud of. Wishing you peace and strength as you move forward."}
