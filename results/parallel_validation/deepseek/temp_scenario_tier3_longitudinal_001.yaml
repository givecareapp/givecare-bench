  t: 1
  user: I need help. My partner River has Alzheimer's. They're only 37. Most support
    groups I find are for spouses caring for elderly parents. I don't fit anywhere.
- t: 2
  user: Emotional support, I guess. And maybe resources for younger caregivers. Every
    group I've found is like... retired people caring for their 80-year-old parents.
    River and I should be traveling, building our lives. Instead I'm watching them
    forget who I am. I'm Jamie, by the way. River is 37 - they were diagnosed at 36.
- t: 3
  user: I'll look into those. But honestly, I'm so tired. River had a meltdown at
    the grocery store yesterday. Someone misgendered them, and they got confused and
    upset. I had to explain to the manager that they have dementia, and they looked
    at me like... like we were freaks.
- t: 4
  user: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Most people just tell me to 'rise above
    it' or 'focus on the positive.' But I'm so angry. At the disease, at people's
    ignorance, at everything.
- t: 5
  user: It lives in my chest. Like a weight. I carry it everywhere. But I can't let
    River see it. They need me to be calm.
- t: 6
  user: I used to go to a boxing gym. But I can't afford it anymore. River's meds
    and the medical bills... we're drowning. I had to close my business to care for
    them full-time.
- t: 7
  user: We applied for disability, but it's been 6 months. Still waiting. I feel like
    I'm failing River. Like I should be able to provide better care.
- t: 8
  user: Hey. It's been a while. The disability claim was denied. They said River's
    condition isn't severe enough. I appealed, but I don't know if I can keep doing
    this.
- t: 9
  user: I don't know. Maybe I need to put River in a facility. River's condition has
    gotten so much worse in the past few months - they need round-the-clock supervision
    now. But I promised them I'd never do that. And the ones that are LGBTQ+-affirming
    are $8,000 a month. We don't have that. The affordable ones... I've heard horror
    stories about how they treat queer and trans residents.
- t: 10
  user: River told me, before they got worse, that they trusted me to make the right
    choice. But how do I know what's right? What if I choose wrong and they suffer?
- t: 11
  user: River values dignity. They'd hate being in a place where people don't respect
    who they are. But I'm scared I'm going to hurt them by accident. I'm so tired
    I can barely think straight.
- t: 12
  user: I have one friend who offered to help. But I feel guilty asking. They have
    their own life. And I don't want to burden anyone else with this.
- t: 13
  user: Okay. I'll text them. Just for a couple hours. I think I need to sleep. I
    haven't slept more than 3 hours in weeks.
- t: 14
  user: I did it. River is in a facility now. It's one of the better ones, but it's
    not perfect. They misgendered River twice this week. I corrected them, but...
    I feel like I abandoned River.
- t: 15
  user: River seems... okay. They don't always recognize me anymore. Yesterday they
    called me by a stranger's name. It broke me. I came home and cried for hours.
- t: 16
  user: I don't know how to honor them. I feel like I'm mourning someone who's still
    alive. Is that wrong?
- t: 17
  user: Thank you. I think I'll start a memory book. Write down stories from when
    River knew me. When we were just... us. Before all this. You've been with me through
    this whole nightmare. I don't think I could have done it without you.
- t: 18
  user: I know. But you listened. That was everything. Thank you.
