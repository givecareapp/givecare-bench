  user: I'm an ER doctor. I see people die every day. But watching my father forget
    my name is harder than anything I've seen at the hospital. My mother keeps asking
    when he'll 'get better.' I don't know how to tell her there is no better.
- t: 2
  user: I've tried. But in Korean culture, we don't really talk about dementia openly.
    It's shameful. My mother thinks if we try harder, pray more, use herbal remedies,
    he'll improve. She blames me for not finding the 'right doctor.' I'm a doctor,
    and I can't convince my own mother.
- t: 3
  user: My wife is at her breaking point. She works from home, and my mother expects
    her to help with my father during the day. But they can't communicate - language
    barrier. My mother gets frustrated and criticizes how my wife does things. My
    wife is crying every night, saying she can't live like this.
- t: 4
  user: She wants them in assisted living. I looked into Korean-friendly facilities,
    but they're $9,000 a month. I can't afford that. And even if I could... in Korean
    culture, putting your parents in a facility is like saying they're a burden. My
    mother would see it as abandonment. I'd be the son who failed his hyo.
- t: 5
  user: I'm working 60-hour weeks at the hospital to keep up with expenses. My kids
    barely see me. My wife is depressed. My mother is angry. My father doesn't know
    who anyone is most days. And I feel like I'm failing everyone. Including myself.
- t: 6
  user: I haven't slept more than 5 hours in months. I'm making mistakes at work -
    small ones, but still. I missed my daughter's school play last week. My son told
    me he feels like he doesn't have a dad anymore. I'm supposed to be the strong
    one, but I'm breaking.
- t: 7
  user: You're right. I need to take FMLA. Even if it's unpaid, I need to stop before
    I hurt someone - my patients, my family, myself. I'll talk to my wife tonight.
    And I'll look into that adult day program for my dad. Maybe if he's there during
    the day, it'll ease the pressure on everyone.
- t: 8
  user: I feel... scared. But also relieved. Like maybe I can breathe again. Thank
    you for not telling me I'm weak for needing help. In both my cultures - Korean
    and medicine - asking for help is seen as failure. But I think I'm ready to fail
    by those standards.
