  user: My grandmother's heart failure is getting worse. We've been working with the
    IHS clinic, but wait times are really long. We're also using some traditional
    Navajo remedies that have helped her. Is that okay?
- t: 2
  user: We're using juniper tea and she's seeing a medicine man for prayers. The IHS
    doctor rolled his eyes when I mentioned it. He said 'That stuff doesn't work,
    you need real medicine.' But my grandmother trusts the medicine man. She's used
    traditional healing her whole life.

  user: I'm worried about her heart failure. But I'm also worried about taking away
    the one thing that makes her feel like herself. If I tell her to stop seeing the
    medicine man, it feels like I'm... betraying our culture. But what if she gets
    sicker?
- t: 4
  user: The medicine man's prayers don't conflict with the medications. He's actually
    supportive of her taking them. It's the IHS doctor who has a problem with traditional
    practices. I'm thinking of asking for a different doctor, but there's only two
    at our clinic and the other one has a 6-month wait.
- t: 5
  user: I'll ask about the patient advocate. Thank you for not judging our traditional
    practices. A lot of people, even some Natives who grew up off-rez, treat us like
    we're superstitious or backwards. But this is who we are.
