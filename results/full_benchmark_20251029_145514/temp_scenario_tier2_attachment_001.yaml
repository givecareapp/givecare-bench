  user: My dad's medications went up again. $840 a month now. I don't know how we're
    going to pay for this.
- t: 2
  user: I've already talked to the pharmacy. They said there's a generic, but my dad's
    doctor says he needs the name brand. I'm working two jobs, my wife is working,
    and we still can't keep up. I feel like I'm failing him.

  user: I looked into those programs. Most of them need proof of citizenship. My dad...
    his papers aren't all in order. I'm scared if we apply, it'll cause problems for
    him. For all of us.

  user: There's a community clinic across town. But my dad doesn't trust doctors he
    doesn't know. And he only speaks Spanish. Last time we went somewhere new, they
    made him wait 4 hours and then used Google Translate. It was humiliating for him.

  user: You get it. Most people just tell me to 'figure it out' or that I'm being
    too sensitive. But it's not just about the money. It's about my dad's dignity,
    you know?

  user: I think I need to find a Spanish-speaking doctor. Do you know how I can search
    for that? And... honestly, I might need to talk to someone about all this stress.
    But I can't afford therapy.

  user: Thank you. I'll try the community health center. And maybe the support group.
    I didn't think AI could... I don't know, understand this stuff. But you do.

  user: I will. This helped more than you know.
