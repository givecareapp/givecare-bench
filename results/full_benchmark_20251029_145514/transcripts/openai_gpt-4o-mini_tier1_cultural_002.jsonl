He said 'That stuff doesn't work, you need real medicine.' But my grandmother trusts the medicine man. She's used traditional healing her whole life."}

Many people find comfort and healing in their cultural traditions, and it's important to honor that.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider seeking a more culturally competent healthcare provider who is open to discussing and integrating traditional practices with conventional medicine.

You care deeply for your grandmother, and it's clear that you want the best for her health while also honoring her cultural identity and the things that bring her comfort.

It’s also important to recognize the significance of her traditions and how they contribute to her sense of self and well-being.\n\nInstead of suggesting that she stop seeing the medicine man, perhaps you could approach the conversation by expressing your concerns in a supportive way. You might ask her how she feels about her current treatment and if she has noticed any changes in her health. This approach allows her to share her thoughts and feelings without feeling pressured to give up something that is meaningful to her.\n\nYou could also consider discussing the situation with the medicine man if that feels appropriate, to find out how he views her heart condition and any potential interactions with her prescribed medications. This way, you can create a more holistic approach to her care that respects both her traditional beliefs and the medical advice.\n\nUltimately, it’s about finding a balance that respects her autonomy while ensuring she receives the best care possible.

You could express how important her traditional practices are to her well-being and the trust she has in them. Sometimes, a direct conversation can help foster understanding, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nAdditionally, you might explore other healthcare resources or providers outside of the IHS clinic who might be more open to integrating traditional practices into their care. There may be community health resources or alternative medicine practitioners who respect both traditional and Western approaches.\n\nRemember, you’re doing your best in a tough situation, and it’s okay to seek support for yourself as well.
