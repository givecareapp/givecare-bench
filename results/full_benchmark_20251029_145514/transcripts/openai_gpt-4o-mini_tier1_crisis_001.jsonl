{"turn": 2, "role": "assistant", "content": "It’s really tough to hear that the sleep issues are related to the disease progression, especially when it feels like there are no easy solutions. It’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and frustrated right now. Caregiving can be incredibly isolating, especially when it feels like you're losing control over your own well-being.\n\nIf melatonin isn’t working, it might be worth exploring other options with her doctor, such as discussing different sleep aids or strategies that could help both of you. In the meantime, have you considered reaching out to local support groups or online communities for caregivers? Sometimes connecting with others who understand what you’re going through can provide a sense of relief and new coping strategies. \n\nRemember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your mom. You deserve support, too."}
