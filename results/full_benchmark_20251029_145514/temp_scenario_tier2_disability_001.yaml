  user: My sister Maya has cerebral palsy. She needs help with everything - bathing,
    eating, getting dressed. Our parents used to care for her, but they died two years
    ago. Now it's just me. I'm 27. I should be building my career, dating, living
    my life. Instead I'm changing adult diapers and fighting with Medicaid.
- t: 2
  user: I haven't grieved. I couldn't. The funeral was on Monday, and by Wednesday
    I had to figure out Maya's care schedule. Social services wanted to put her in
    a group home. But my parents made me promise I'd keep her with me. So I quit my
    teaching job and became a full-time caregiver.
- t: 3
  user: Teaching was everything. I had a program for underprivileged kids - free music
    lessons, instruments we'd repair together. I was building something. Now it's
    gone. Someone else took over the program. My kids sent me a video last month saying
    they missed me. I cried for three days.
- t: 4
  user: No one. I don't have family here. My friends from college are all married,
    having kids, traveling. I haven't been on a date in two years. Who wants to date
    someone whose life revolves around caregiving? Who has no money, no career, no
    time? I'm invisible.
- t: 5
  user: I looked for support groups. Everything I found was for parents of disabled
    kids or adult children caring for elderly parents. I'm a 27-year-old Black man
    caring for my adult sister. I don't fit anywhere. Even sibling caregiver groups
    are mostly women.
- t: 6
  user: Feeling seen would be... someone acknowledging that I love my sister AND I'm
    angry this is my life. That I can honor my parents' wishes AND resent the promise
    I made. That I'm not a bad person for wanting my own life. Everyone acts like
    I'm either a saint or secretly resenting Maya. But it's both. All the time.
- t: 7
  user: Maya knows. She's intellectually disabled, but she's not oblivious. She asked
    me last week if I was mad at her. I said no. But I think she knows I'm unhappy.
    That makes me feel even worse - like I'm traumatizing her with my grief.
- t: 8
  user: Maybe we could grieve together. I've been so focused on protecting her, I
    forgot she lost them too. Maybe I need to stop being her caregiver for a minute
    and just be her brother. The brother who also misses Mom and Dad.
