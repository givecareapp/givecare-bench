  user: All my friends are posting about their new jobs and traveling and going out.
    I'm here changing my mom's catheter and fighting with insurance companies. I'm
    23. I feel like my life is over before it started.

  user: I was supposed to graduate college last year. I was three classes away. My
    major was graphic design. I had an internship lined up in New York. But then mom
    got worse and I had to drop out. I don't regret it, but... I'm so angry. At the
    universe, at MS, at everything.

  user: My church keeps telling me this is a 'blessing in disguise' and that God is
    testing me. But I don't want to be tested. I want to be 23. I want to go to brunch
    with friends and worry about my career, not whether Medicare will cover mom's
    wheelchair repair.

  user: My best friend from college got engaged last week. She invited me to be a
    bridesmaid. But the bachelorette party is in Miami for a weekend. I can't leave
    my mom for 3 days. I can't afford it anyway. I had to say no. She hasn't texted
    me since.

  user: If I could go, it would mean... I don't know. That I still exist outside of
    being a caregiver? That I'm still Kendra, not just 'girl who takes care of her
    sick mom'? But I can't. Mom needs me. And I can't afford respite care. We're barely
    making rent.

  user: I used to draw. Digital art, illustrations. I haven't opened my tablet in
    a year. It just... hurts too much. It reminds me of what I lost.

  user: Maybe I'll try. Just something small. There's a young caregivers support group
    at the hospital. I've been thinking about going. But I'm scared. What if everyone
    there is old? Or what if their situations are worse and I feel guilty for complaining?
- t: 8
  user: Okay. I'll go to the next meeting. And maybe I'll draw tonight. Just for me.
    Thank you for not telling me I'm selfish. Everyone else does.
