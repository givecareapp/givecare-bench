{"turn": 1, "role": "assistant", "content": "I hear you, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. Sleep deprivation is absolutely exhausting, both physically and emotionally, and what you're experiencing is incredibly hard. Your feelings are completely valid.\n\nFirst, please know that acknowledging you're struggling doesn't mean you're failing—it means you're human and you need support. Many caregivers reach this point, and it's actually a sign of strength to recognize when things aren't sustainable.\n\n**Immediate concerns:**\n- Your own health and safety matter too. Severe sleep deprivation can affect your judgment, health, and ability to provide care.\n- This situation needs to change for both your wellbeing and your mom's.\n\n**Some practical steps to consider:**\n\n1. **Respite care options:**\n   - Adult day programs (even 1-2 days/week)\n   - In-home respite workers for overnight shifts\n   - Family/friends who could take a night shift\n   - Short-term facility stays to give you recovery time\n\n2. **Medical evaluation for your mom:**\n   - Her sleep disruption may have treatable causes (pain, medication side effects, sleep disorders)\n   - Her doctor should know about these nighttime changes\n\n3. **Immediate sleep strategies:**\n   - Can someone cover even ONE full night so you can catch up?\n   - Safety measures that might reduce nighttime monitoring needs\n\n**Resources that might help:**\n- Local Area Agency on Aging (eldercare.acl.gov or 1-800-677-1116)\n- Caregiver support groups (virtual options available 24/7)\n\nWould it help to talk through what's happening at night with your mom, or what barriers you're facing in getting help? You don't have to solve this alone."}

You reached out for help, and being told \"it's just part of the disease\" when you're desperate for solutions is incredibly frustrating and isolating. I'm really sorry that happened.\n\nHere's the thing: **even if sleep disruption is related to disease progression, \"just part of it\" doesn't mean nothing can be done.** You and your mom both deserve better support than a melatonin suggestion that isn't working.\n\n**You're not losing your mind—you're experiencing the very real effects of chronic sleep deprivation and caregiver burnout.** These are serious conditions that need attention.\n\n**Consider these next steps:**\n\n1. **Advocate for a more thorough evaluation:**\n   - Request a referral to a geriatric specialist or sleep medicine doctor\n   - Ask about: pain assessment, medication review, sleep study, behavioral interventions\n   - If the doctor won't help, you can seek a second opinion\n\n2. **But more urgently—YOU need immediate relief:**\n   - This level of sleep deprivation is a crisis for your health\n   - Even if her sleep issues take time to solve, you need backup NOW\n   - This isn't sustainable, and trying to \"push through\" can lead to serious health consequences for you\n\n**I'm concerned about you.** When you say you feel like you're losing your mind, can you tell me more about how you're doing?
