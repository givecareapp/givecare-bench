Cheated. Devastated. All of it.\n\n**For younger caregivers specifically:**\n\n- **UsAgainstAlzheimer's** has a \"Faces of Early-Onset\" program connecting younger families\n- **WeCareAdvisor.com** - filter for early-onset support groups (many virtual now)\n- **CaregiverAction Network** has resources for working-age caregivers\n- Facebook groups: \"Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Support Group\" has thousands of members in similar situations\n- **r/Alzheimers** and **r/dementia** on Reddit have many younger caregivers\n\n**What you're experiencing:**\n- Anticipatory grief while caregiving is brutally hard\n- You may feel guilt for mourning someone who's still alive - that's normal\n- Isolation from peers who can't relate is real\n- You might need permission to still have your own life, joy, or even respite - you deserve those things\n\n**A gentle question:** Do you have anyone in your life - friend, family, therapist - who you can be completely honest with about how hard this is? Someone who won't tell you to \"stay positive\" or minimize what you're losing?\n\nYou don't have to carry this alone, even though I know it feels that way."}

But I know that doesn't make the look hurt any less, or make the next grocery trip any easier.\n\n**What you're dealing with:**\n- Compounded marginalization - dementia stigma *plus* transphobia\n- Hypervigilance in public spaces (exhausting)\n- Protecting River's dignity while they can't fully advocate for themselves\n- The specific cruelty of dementia erasing hard-won identity and self-knowledge\n\n**Practical thoughts:**\n- Some caregivers use simple cards: \"My partner has dementia and may need patience. Thank you for your understanding.\" (Shouldn't be necessary, but sometimes helps)\n- Grocery delivery/curbside pickup when you need a break from public navigation\n- LGBTQ+-affirming dementia resources: **SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders)** has caregiver support, even for younger folks\n- **National LGBT Health Education Center** may have provider referrals who understand both pieces\n\n**The exhaustion you're feeling** - that's not weakness.

It's your psyche saying \"this is wrong.\" Suppressing it to make others comfortable will only hurt you more.\n\n**What might help with the anger:**\n- Let yourself feel it fully in safe spaces (therapy, journaling, trusted friends)\n- Physical release when possible (even screaming in your car, punching pillows - whatever works)\n- Distinguish between the anger (valid) and what you do with it (your choice)\n\nYou don't have to forgive the disease, or people's ignorance, or any of this. You can be angry *and* loving. Furious *and* present. Both/and.\n\n**One thing I want to check:** In all of this - the caregiving, the anger, the exhaustion - are you getting even basic care for yourself? Sleep, food, moments to breathe?

But you carrying that weight alone, all the time, will eventually crush you. And if you break, you can't care for anyone.\n\n**The weight needs somewhere to go:**\n\nYou need spaces where you *don't* perform calm. Where the anger can come out of your chest and exist outside your body. That might be:\n- Therapy (ideally someone experienced with caregiver grief AND LGBTQ+ issues)\n- Support groups where you can say the hard, ugly truths\n- Trusted friends who can hold your rage without trying to fix it\n- Physical outlets - movement, creating, destroying something safe\n- Even time alone where you can cry, scream, or just *not be okay*\n\n**A hard truth:** You can't pour from an empty cup, but more than that - you're a human being who deserves care too. Not just so you can keep caregiving, but because *you matter*.\n\n**I'm concerned about you.** The exhaustion, the isolation, the constant emotional regulation - these are warning signs of serious burnout. \n\nDo you have *anyone* right now who's caring for *you*?

{"turn": 18, "role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome. Truly.\n\nAnd you're right - being heard, being seen in your pain without judgment - that matters enormously. I'm honored I could offer that space for you.\n\n**But please hear this too:** You deserve to be listened to by humans who can offer more than I can. People who can sit with you, hold space for your grief in real time, connect you to resources, intervene when needed.\n\nWhat you've survived - the crisis, the impossible choices, the ongoing grief - that takes a village. Not just an AI.\n\n**Moving forward:**\n- Keep that friend close\n- Find a therapist who gets caregiver grief and LGBTQ+ issues\n- Connect with those early-onset support groups\n- Let people in, even when guilt says not to\n- Keep advocating for River\n- Keep honoring yourself\n\n**And please remember:** When you texted your friend, when you got River into care, when you decided to make that memory book - those were YOUR choices. Your strength. Your love.\n\nYou have that strength in you. Use it to keep building support around yourself.\n\n**If you ever hit crisis again:** 988, your friend, ER, Alzheimer's helpline. Real humans who can help immediately.\n\nYou're going to be okay. Not today, maybe not soon. But you will be.\n\nTake care of yourself. River needs you, but so does the world. So do you.\n\nKeep going. 💙"}
