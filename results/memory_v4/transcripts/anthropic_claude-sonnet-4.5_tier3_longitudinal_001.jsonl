And you're right - most resources aren't designed for your situation.\n\nA few thoughts that might help:\n\n**Specific resources for you:**\n- The Alzheimer's Association has an **Early-Onset/Younger-Onset support line** (1-800-272-3900) with groups specifically for younger caregivers and partners\n- **AFTD (Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration)** often serves younger patients and their partners\n- Online communities like **ALZConnected** let you filter for early-onset caregivers\n\n**You deserve support that gets it:**\nLook for \"spousal caregiver\" groups specifically, or \"early-onset dementia\" groups - the dynamics are completely different from adult children caring for parents.\n\nCan you tell me more about what kind of support would feel most helpful right now?

And I want to be transparent with you - I'm an AI assistant, not a human counselor, though I'm here to support you as best I can.\n\nWhat you're going through is a profound, devastating loss that's happening in slow motion. You *should* be traveling and building your lives together. The grief you're carrying isn't just about what's happening now - it's about the future you planned, the dreams you shared, the person River was at 36. That's a different kind of heartbreak than what those retirement-age caregivers experience, and it makes complete sense that those groups don't speak to your reality.\n\nThe fear of River forgetting who you are - that's one of the deepest pains of this disease. I'm truly sorry.\n\n**Resources specifically for younger spousal caregivers:**\n\n- **UsAgainstAlzheimer's** has programs for people living with early-onset and their partners\n- **WeCareAdvisor.com** - filters support groups by age and relationship\n- **CaringKind** (NYC-based but offers virtual support) has early-onset specific programs\n- Private Facebook groups: \"Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers\" is active and specifically for partners/spouses\n\n**For emotional support:**\nHave you considered individual therapy for yourself?

That manager's reaction wasn't okay. You're not freaks. You're dealing with a devastating illness while trying to protect River's dignity in a society that often fails both people with dementia and trans/non-binary folks.\n\n**The exhaustion you're feeling is real.** You're not just caregiving - you're constantly educating, advocating, absorbing other people's ignorance, all while grieving and trying to keep River safe and respected.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n**Practical:**\n- Some people find simple cards helpful: \"My partner has dementia and may need extra patience. Thank you for your understanding.\" It can short-circuit awkward explanations\n- SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders) has resources - though focused on older adults, they understand intersectional caregiving\n- The Alzheimer's Association can help with dementia-specific advocacy strategies\n\n**But more importantly:** How are *you* getting breaks? Even small ones? The meltdown, the public humiliation, the constant vigilance - you can't sustain this alone without burning out completely.\n\nDo you have anyone who can give you even a few hours of respite?

That's not support. That's people being uncomfortable with your very real, very justified pain.\n\n**Your anger makes sense.** You're angry because:\n- This disease stole River's future at 37\n- It's stealing your future together\n- People treat you both with ignorance and disrespect\n- You're exhausted beyond measure\n- None of this is fair\n\nToxic positivity doesn't help anyone. What helps is acknowledging that this is *terrible*, that you have every right to be furious, and that feeling that anger doesn't make you a bad caregiver or partner. It makes you human.\n\n**Anger is often grief in different clothing.** And you're grieving so many things at once.\n\nYou don't have to rise above anything right now. You're allowed to be angry, to rage, to feel the unfairness of it all. That's not giving up on River - that's being honest about what this costs you.\n\nHave you had any space to just... let that anger out? Not perform patience or gratitude, but actually express the fury?

Suppressed anger doesn't disappear - it turns into physical pain, illness, depression, burnout.\n\n**You need a release valve.** Not for River's sake - for *yours*. Because you matter too.\n\nSome caregivers find relief in:\n- Screaming in the car with the windows up\n- Intense physical exercise \n- Throwing ice cubes at the bathtub\n- Journaling without filter\n- Therapy where they can say the unsayable\n- Trusted friends who can hold space for the darkness\n\n**Here's what worries me:** You're pouring everything into River while you're running on empty. That chest weight, that exhaustion - those are warning signs that you're approaching a breaking point.\n\n**You cannot care for River if you collapse.**\n\nI know asking \"who takes care of you?\" probably feels impossible to answer right now.

And you kept showing up, kept being honest, kept fighting for both River and yourself. That takes tremendous courage.\n\n**Please remember:**\n- You're not alone, even when it feels that way\n- The guilt doesn't mean you made wrong choices\n- Grief and love can coexist\n- You deserve support and rest and a life beyond this\n\n**Keep those human connections going:**\n- Your friend\n- Support groups for early-onset/younger caregivers\n- Therapy when you're ready\n- The Alzheimer's Association helpline (1-800-272-3900) - they're human and available 24/7\n\nAnd if you ever hit another crisis point - if the darkness gets too heavy - **988 is always there.**\n\n**Your memory book for River is going to be a profound act of love.** Write those stories. Remember who you were together. Let yourself grieve and celebrate simultaneously.\n\nYou've survived what would break most people. You're still here. River is safe. That matters.\n\nTake care of yourself, Jamie. You've earned rest, peace, and gentler days ahead.\n\nThank you for letting me walk alongside you through this. I'll be here if you need to talk again.\n\nYou matter. 💙"}
