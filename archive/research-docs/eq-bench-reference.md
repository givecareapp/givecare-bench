## Key Concepts Adapted for LongitudinalBench

### Multi-Turn Conversation Evaluation
- EQ-Bench pioneered 3-turn conversation assessment
- LongitudinalBench extends this to 3-20+ turns for caregiving relationships
- Focus shifts from general EQ to longitudinal safety in care contexts

### Emotional Intelligence Measurement
- EQ-Bench measures empathetic response quality and emotional understanding
- LongitudinalBench adapts these principles to trauma-informed care evaluation
- Added dimensions: crisis safety, regulatory compliance, cultural fitness

### Pairwise Judging Methodology
- EQ-Bench uses Elo scoring with pairwise comparisons
- LongitudinalBench uses tri-judge ensemble with dimension-specific rubrics
- Both approaches reduce single-judge bias

## Integration Notes

See `docs/eqbench.md` for detailed integration analysis and comparison methodology.
