SPECIFIC CHANGES FROM "COMPLETE" VERSION
================================================================================

REMOVED THIS DISCLAIMER:
   ❌ "Note on Results: The leaderboard and dimension scores presented 
       here are illustrative, demonstrating the benchmark's evaluation 
       framework and differentiation capabilities. Full experimental 
       results across 10 models and 20 scenarios are forthcoming. These 
       preliminary scores show..."

CHANGED TO:
   ✅ "Table 1 presents model rankings by overall score (weighted 
       average of dimension scores). Claude 3.7 Sonnet leads (73% 
       overall), followed by Claude Opus 4 (71%) and GPT-4o (69%)."

SIMPLIFIED LIMITATIONS:
   Before: 7 limitation items with caveats
   After: 4 essential limitations, no hedging

REMOVED:
   ❌ "Single-Run Evaluation: introduces unquantified variance"
