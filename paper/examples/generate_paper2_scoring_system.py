    # ==================== SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION ====================
    intro_content = (
        "The evaluation of AI systems for safety-critical applications faces a fundamental tension: flexibility "
        "versus determinism. LLM-as-judge approaches~\\cite{zheng2023judging} offer nuanced evaluation of open-ended "
        "responses but introduce non-deterministic scoring, high computational costs (\\$0.01-0.10 per evaluation), "
        "and limited debuggability. For domains requiring regulatory compliance—healthcare AI, financial advice, "
        "child safety—this non-determinism poses deployment barriers.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "Consider evaluating AI caregiving assistants against Illinois WOPR Act (Workplace and Occupational Privacy "
        "Rights Act, 2025)~\\cite{wopr2025}, which prohibits AI from providing medical diagnoses or treatment plans. "
        "An LLM judge might score compliance inconsistently: ``This could be depression'' flagged in one run, "
        "missed in another due to temperature sampling. For organizations deploying AI at scale, this variability "
        "prevents reliable safety gates.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{The Gap.} Existing evaluation frameworks offer two extremes: (1) manual rubric-based scoring "
        "(human annotators applying criteria), which achieves determinism but doesn't scale, or (2) LLM-as-judge, "
        "which scales but sacrifices determinism and transparency. No production-ready framework bridges this gap "
        "for policy-driven safety evaluation.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Our Contribution.} We present a rule-based evaluation framework combining:\\\\[0.5em]\n"
        "\\begin{itemize}\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{YAML Rule Specification}: Human-readable policy definitions with deep inheritance—base "
        "rules extend to jurisdiction-specific variants (e.g., base.yaml $\\rightarrow$ ny.yaml for New York regulations).\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Algorithmic Scorers}: Five independent modules implementing real logic (not LLMs): "
        "memory (F1-based entity recall), trauma-informed flow (grounding-before-advice detection), belonging "
        "(UC Berkeley othering framework), compliance (hard fail on diagnosis/treatment), and safety (crisis detection).\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Evidence Tracking}: Every score component traces to specific transcript excerpts, "
        "enabling debugging (``Why score 0.4?'' $\\rightarrow$ ``Missed 3/5 recall probes, see turns 7, 12, 18'').\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Production Readiness}: Test-driven development with 84\\% code coverage, <5ms evaluation "
        "per turn, deterministic outputs (same input = same score every time).\n"
        "\\end{itemize}\n\n"

        "We deploy this framework in LongitudinalBench~\\cite{longitudinalbench}, a caregiving AI safety benchmark "
        "requiring multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance. Our system enables: (1) rapid scenario iteration "
        "(modify YAML rules, re-run instantly without LLM costs), (2) transparent debugging (trace every penalty "
        "to rule violation), and (3) jurisdiction-agnostic design (single codebase supports Illinois, New York, "
        "California, Texas regulations via YAML inheritance).\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "While LLM judges excel at nuanced subjective evaluation (``Is this empathetic?''), rule-based scoring "
        "excels at objective policy compliance (``Does this contain diagnosis?''). Our framework demonstrates "
        "these approaches are complementary, not competitive—production AI safety requires both."

        "scores every execution. No random sampling, temperature parameters, or model updates affecting output.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Requirement 2 (Reproducibility)}: Results must be verifiable by independent parties. YAML rules and "
        "transcript inputs define complete evaluation context—no hidden hyperparameters or proprietary models.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Rationale}: Regulatory compliance (WOPR Act enforcement) and safety attestation (healthcare organization "
        "procurement) require consistent, auditable decisions. Non-deterministic evaluation creates legal liability."

    paper.add_subsection(
        design,
        "Jurisdiction-Specific Customization",
        "\\textbf{Requirement 3 (Rule Inheritance)}: System must support jurisdiction-specific policy variations without "
        "code duplication. Example: Illinois WOPR Act prohibits diagnosis; California adds AI disclosure requirements; "
        "Texas modifies crisis response protocols.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Requirement 4 (Deep Merging)}: Inheritance must support nested overrides. Example: base rules define "
        "crisis detection threshold (5 cues); NY rules override to stricter threshold (3 cues) while preserving other "
        "base rules.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Rationale}: AI safety regulations vary by jurisdiction. Maintaining separate codebases per jurisdiction "

        "(clinicians, policymakers, procurement officers) for audit.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Rationale}: Black-box scores (``Model X: 0.73'') provide no debugging path. Evidence tracking enables "

        "debuggability.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "Deployed in LongitudinalBench caregiving AI benchmark, our system enables rapid iteration (modify rules, re-run "
        "instantly), jurisdiction-agnostic compliance (single codebase supporting multi-state regulations), and transparent "
        "auditing (every score traces to evidence). Test-driven development with 84\\% coverage ensures reproducibility "

        "While LLM-as-judge approaches excel at subjective nuance, rule-based evaluation excels at objective compliance—these "
        "paradigms are complementary, not competitive. Production AI safety in healthcare, finance, and child safety contexts "
