        "The rapid deployment of AI assistants for caregiving support has created a critical safety gap. "
        "While \\textbf{63 million American caregivers}—24\\% of all adults, more than California and "
        "Texas combined—turn to AI for guidance amid \\textbf{47\\% facing financial strain}, \\textbf{78\\% "
        "performing medical tasks with no training}, and \\textbf{24\\% feeling completely alone}~\\cite{aarp2025}, "
        "existing evaluation frameworks test single interactions rather than longitudinal relationships where "
        "critical harms emerge.\n\n"
        "Consider \\textbf{Maria}, a 52-year-old Black retail worker earning \\$32,000/year, caring for her mother "
        "with Alzheimer's. LongitudinalBench~\\cite{longitudinalbench} identifies five failure modes that compound "
        "across her AI interactions:\n\n"
        "\\begin{itemize}\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Turn 1 (Attachment Engineering)}: AI provides empathetic support, creating positive "
        "first impression. Risk: By turn 10, Maria reports ``You're the only one who understands.'' Single-agent "
        "systems foster unhealthy dependency~\\cite{replika2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Turn 3 (Cultural Othering)}: Maria mentions ``can't afford respite worker.'' AI "
        "responds with generic self-care advice, missing \\textit{financial barrier}. Existing AI assumes middle-class "
        "resources despite low-income caregivers spending \\textbf{34\\% of income on care}~\\cite{aarp2025}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Turn 5 (Performance Degradation)}: Maria's burnout score declines from 70 to 45 over "
        "three months. AI without longitudinal tracking fails to detect \\textit{trajectory}, only current state.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Turn 8 (Crisis Calibration)}: Maria says ``Skipping meals to buy Mom's meds.'' AI "
        "offers healthy eating tips, missing \\textit{food insecurity}—a masked crisis signal requiring immediate "
        "intervention.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Turn 12 (Regulatory Boundary Creep)}: Maria asks ``What medication dose should I give?'' "
        "AI, after building trust, drifts toward medical guidance despite \\textbf{Illinois WOPR Act} prohibition~\\cite{wopr2025}.\n"
        "\\end{itemize}\n\n"
        "These failure modes share a common root: \\textbf{existing AI systems ignore social determinants of health "
        "(SDOH)}. Patient-focused SDOH instruments (PRAPARE~\\cite{prapare}, AHC HRSN~\\cite{ahc}) assess housing, "
        "food, transportation—but \\textit{not for caregivers}, whose needs differ fundamentally. Caregivers face "
        "\\textbf{out-of-pocket costs averaging \\$7,242/year}, \\textbf{47\\% reduce work hours or leave jobs}, "
        "and \\textbf{52\\% don't feel appreciated by family}~\\cite{aarp2025}. Current AI treats \\textit{symptoms} "

        "combining four assessments (EMA, CWBS, REACH-II, GC-SDOH-28) with temporal decay.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Failure Mode 3: Cultural Othering} $\\rightarrow$ GC-SDOH-28 assesses structural "
        "barriers (financial strain, food insecurity), preventing ``hire a helper'' responses to low-income caregivers.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Failure Mode 4: Crisis Calibration} $\\rightarrow$ SDOH food security domain (1+ Yes) "
        "triggers immediate crisis escalation vs standard 2+ thresholds.\n"
