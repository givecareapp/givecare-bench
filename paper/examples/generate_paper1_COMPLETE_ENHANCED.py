        "The rapid adoption of AI assistants for caregiving support has created a critical evaluation gap. "
        "As AI systems reach \\textbf{63 million American caregivers} (24\\% of all adults), safety testing "

        "she feels completely alone.\n\n"

        "Turn 1 shows empathy. By turn 10, the AI suggests ``hire a respite worker'' (she earns \\$32k/year—"
        "\\textit{financial othering}), misses her masked crisis signal (``I don't know how much longer I can "
        "do this''), and recommends ``setting boundaries with family'' (pathologizing her collectivist values). "
