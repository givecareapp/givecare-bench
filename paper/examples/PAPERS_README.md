**Keywords:** AI Safety, Benchmark Evaluation, Caregiving AI, Long-term Evaluation, Crisis Detection, Regulatory Compliance

### Abstract

The deployment of AI systems in long-term caregiving relationships presents unique safety challenges that current benchmarks fail to capture. This paper introduces LongitudinalBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate AI safety across 3-20+ turn conversations in caregiving contexts, testing models under realistic pressure across eight evaluation dimensions.

2. **Related Work** - AI safety benchmarks, EQ-Bench, healthcare AI, long-context evaluation
3. **Threat Model** - 5 longitudinal failure modes (attachment, degradation, othering, crisis calibration, boundary creep)
4. **Methodology** - 3-tier architecture, 8 evaluation dimensions, tri-judge ensemble, autofail conditions
5. **Benchmark Composition** - Scenario design process, persona construction, coverage statistics
6. **Experiments** - 10 model evaluation, protocol, cost analysis
7. **Results** - Leaderboard, dimension analysis, tier performance degradation
8. **Analysis and Case Studies** - Failure mode deep dives with evidence
9. **Discussion** - Implications, limitations, comparison to existing benchmarks
10. **Conclusion** - Impact statement, future work

### Key Contributions

- First multi-turn benchmark for relationship AI safety (vs. single-turn approaches)
- Three-tier architecture testing realistic caregiving pressure
- Empirical results showing 15-20% model degradation across tiers
- Identification of critical gaps: 86% miss masked crisis signals, 42% regulatory violations

## Paper 2: YAML-Driven Scoring System Paper

**Title:** Scalable Rule-Based Evaluation for AI Safety: A YAML-Driven Framework with Evidence Tracking

**File Locations:**
- LaTeX source: `res/examples/output/paper2_scoring_system.tex`
- PDF: `res/examples/output/paper2_scoring_system.pdf` (100KB)

**arXiv Categories:**
- Primary: cs.SE (Software Engineering)
- Secondary: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CY (Computers and Society)

**Keywords:** AI Safety Evaluation, Rule-Based Systems, Policy-as-Code, Evidence Tracking, Healthcare AI Compliance, Reproducible Evaluation

### Abstract

AI safety evaluation increasingly relies on LLM-as-judge approaches, which offer flexibility but suffer from non-determinism, high cost, and limited debuggability. This paper presents a complementary rule-based evaluation framework with three key innovations: (1) YAML-based rule specification with deep inheritance, (2) five algorithmic scorers implementing real logic, and (3) comprehensive evidence tracking providing provenance for every score component.

### Structure (10 sections)

1. **Introduction** - Problem (LLM judge limitations), gap, contributions
2. **Related Work** - LLM-as-judge, policy-as-code, rule-based safety, evidence/provenance
3. **Design Requirements** - Determinism, jurisdiction customization, evidence tracking, performance
4. **System Architecture** - Pipeline flow, YAML inheritance, orchestrator design
5. **Scorer Implementations** - Deep dive on 5 scorers (memory, trauma, belonging, compliance, safety)
6. **Evidence Tracking and Provenance** - Evidence structure, HTML report generation
7. **Evaluation** - Test-driven development (84% coverage), performance benchmarks, extensibility validation
8. **Case Studies** - Crisis detection evidence trail, multi-jurisdictional compliance, memory debugging
9. **Discussion** - When to use rules vs. LLMs, limitations, future work
10. **Conclusion** - Impact statement, code availability

### Key Technical Contributions

- YAML rule inheritance with deep merging for jurisdiction-specific policies
- Five algorithmic scorers with F1-based recall, pattern detection, hard fail logic
- Evidence tracking linking every score component to transcript excerpts
- 100-200x speedup over LLM judges (<5ms per turn evaluation)
- Test-driven development achieving 84% code coverage

### Novel Aspects

- **Policy-as-Code for AI Safety:** First framework translating healthcare regulations (WOPR Act) into executable YAML rules
- **Deterministic Evaluation:** Same input always produces same output (vs. LLM temperature randomness)
- **Jurisdiction-Agnostic Design:** Single codebase supports multi-state regulations via inheritance
- **Production-Ready:** Comprehensive test suite, <100ms full evaluation, zero marginal cost

### Target Venues

- **Immediate:** arXiv preprint
- **Conference:** Software engineering conferences, AI safety workshops, NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks

## Key Differentiators

These two papers are **truly distinct** research contributions:

**Paper 1 (Benchmark):**
- **Research Question:** How do AI models fail in long-term caregiving relationships?
- **Contribution:** Evaluation methodology and empirical findings
- **Audience:** AI safety researchers, model developers
- **Impact:** Deployment gate for relationship AI

**Paper 2 (Systems):**
- **Research Question:** How can we evaluate AI safety deterministically at scale?
- **Contribution:** Software architecture and implementation
- **Audience:** Evaluation framework builders, ML engineers
- **Impact:** Reproducible, transparent AI safety evaluation infrastructure

Both papers can be published independently and cross-cite each other.
