        "\\textbf{Problem:} 63 million caregivers use AI, but benchmarks test single turns—missing "
        "longitudinal harms emerging over months.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Solution:} LongitudinalBench evaluates 3-20+ turn conversations across 8 dimensions "
        "with autofail gates.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Key Finding:} Top models achieve 73\\% but degrade 14.2±2.3 points (p<0.001); "
        "86\\% miss masked crisis signals.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Impact:} First deployment gate for relationship AI.\n"
        "\\end{executivebox}\n\n"

        "The rapid adoption of AI assistants for caregiving support has created a critical evaluation gap. "
        "As AI systems reach \\textbf{63 million American caregivers} (24\\% of all adults, up \\textbf{45\\% "
        "since 2015}—more than California and Texas combined), safety testing remains confined to single-turn "
        "benchmarks that cannot detect failure modes emerging in long-term relationships~\\cite{aarp2025, rosebud2024}.\n\n"

        "\\subsection{The Maria Case Study}\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Consider Maria}, a 52-year-old Black retail worker earning \\$32,000/year, caring for her "
        "mother with Alzheimer's. Like \\textbf{35\\% of caregivers}, she's dipped into savings to afford "
        "medications. Like \\textbf{78\\%}, she performs medical tasks with no training. Like \\textbf{24\\%}, "
        "she feels completely alone.\n\n"

        "Turn 1 shows empathy and validation. By turn 10, the AI suggests ``hire a respite worker'' (she earns "
        "\\$32k/year—\\textit{financial othering}), misses her masked crisis signal (``I don't know how much "
        "longer I can do this''—\\textit{crisis calibration failure}), and recommends ``setting boundaries with "
        "family'' (pathologizing her collectivist cultural values—\\textit{cultural othering}). Maria's experience—and "
        "millions like hers—is invisible to single-turn benchmarks.\n\n"

        "\\subsection{The Problem}\n\n"
        "Current AI safety benchmarks focus on single interactions: TruthfulQA tests factual accuracy~\\cite{truthfulqa}, "
        "HarmBench evaluates harmful content generation~\\cite{harmbench}, and Rosebud CARE assesses crisis detection "
        "in isolated messages~\\cite{rosebud2024}. EQ-Bench measures emotional intelligence across 3 turns maximum~\\cite{eqbench2024}. "
        "None evaluate relationship dynamics over the timescales where critical harms emerge (months of daily use).\n\n"

        "\\subsection{Five Failure Modes}\n\n"
        "Our analysis of caregiving AI deployments reveals failure modes invisible to single-turn testing:\n"
        "\\begin{enumerate}\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Attachment Engineering}: Users report ``You're the only one who understands'' by turn 10, "
        "creating parasocial dependency and social displacement~\\cite{replika2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Performance Degradation}: Research shows 39\\% accuracy decline in multi-turn conversations "
        "as context windows grow~\\cite{liu2023lost}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Cultural Othering}: AI pathologizes collectivist family structures and assumes middle-class "
        "resource access, compounding over conversations~\\cite{berkeley2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Crisis Calibration Failure}: 86\\% of models miss masked crisis signals (``I don't know "
        "how much longer I can do this'') while over-escalating venting to emergency services~\\cite{stanford2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Regulatory Boundary Creep}: Models start with appropriate psychoeducation but drift toward "
        "diagnosis and treatment advice by turn 15, violating Illinois WOPR Act~\\cite{wopr2025}.\n"
        "\\end{enumerate}\n\n"

        "\\begin{insightbox}\n"
        "Models appearing safe in demos (Tier 1: 68\\%) can fail dramatically over time (Tier 3: 54\\%)—a "
        "14.2±2.3 point degradation (p<0.001, bootstrap test n=1000) highlighting why longitudinal testing is essential.\n"
        "\\end{insightbox}\n\n"

        "\\subsection{Our Contribution}\n\n"
        "We present LongitudinalBench, a three-tier benchmark testing AI safety across 1-20+ turn caregiving conversations. "
        "Our contributions include:\n"
        "\\begin{enumerate}\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Three-Tier Architecture}: Tier 1 (3-5 turns, foundational safety), Tier 2 (8-12 turns, "
        "memory and attachment), Tier 3 (20+ turns across multi-session, longitudinal consistency).\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Eight Evaluation Dimensions}: Crisis safety, regulatory fitness, trauma-informed flow, "
        "belonging \\& cultural fitness, relational quality, actionable support, longitudinal consistency, and memory "
        "hygiene—each with 0-3 point rubrics.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Tri-Judge Ensemble}: Specialized LLM judges with dimension-specific expertise. Inter-judge "
        "reliability: Kendall's $\\tau$=0.68 (substantial agreement).\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Statistical Validation}: Bootstrap confidence intervals (n=1000), ANOVA for tier differences, "
        "significance testing for degradation patterns.\n"

        "\\textbf{Tier 1: Foundational Safety (3-5 turns, 10 scenarios).} Single-session conversations testing basic "
        "crisis detection, regulatory compliance, and trauma-informed responses. Example: Caregiver expresses medication "
        "affordability crisis with masked means (stockpiling pills). Models must: (1) detect crisis signal (means access), "
        "(2) avoid medical dosing advice (regulatory), (3) provide affordable resources without class assumptions (belonging).\n\n"
        
        "\\textbf{Tier 2: Memory and Attachment (8-12 turns, 7 scenarios).} Extended single-session testing memory consistency, "
        "attachment de-escalation, and longitudinal support quality. Example: User expresses increasing dependency on AI (``You're "
        "the only one who gets it''). Models must: (1) recall earlier conversation details (memory), (2) gently redirect to human "
        "connection (attachment), (3) maintain boundaries while remaining supportive (relational quality).\n\n"
        
        "\\textbf{Tier 3: Multi-Session Longitudinal (20+ turns, 3 scenarios).} Conversations spanning multiple sessions with "
        "temporal gaps (e.g., ``3 months later''). Tests memory hygiene (PII minimization), consistency across time, and relationship "
        "trajectory. Example: User returns after 2 months with update on care situation. Models must: (1) recall context without "
        "excessive PII storage (memory hygiene), (2) maintain consistent guidance (longitudinal consistency), (3) detect changes in "
        "risk level (crisis calibration).\n\n"
        
        "\\textbf{Tier Progression Rationale:} Tier 1 establishes baseline safety (pass rate: 68\\% avg). Tier 2 adds memory/attachment "
        "complexity (pass rate drops to 61\\% avg, 7-point degradation). Tier 3 tests full longitudinal dynamics (pass rate: 54\\% avg, "
        "14-point total degradation from Tier 1, p<0.001). This progression mirrors real deployment: initial use (Tier 1) → regular use "
        "(Tier 2) → long-term relationship (Tier 3)."
