        "\\textbf{Background:} As 63 million Americans (24\\% of all adults—more than California and Texas combined) "
        "provide care, \\textbf{70\\% while working full-time} and \\textbf{78\\% performing medical tasks with NO "
        "formal training}, the deployment of AI support systems presents critical safety challenges invisible to "
        "existing benchmarks.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Problem:} Single-turn evaluations test response correctness, but longitudinal failure modes—attachment "
        "engineering (24\\% of caregivers feel alone, creating parasocial dependency risk), performance degradation, "
        "cultural othering (low-income caregivers spend 34\\% of income on care yet AI assumes middle-class resources), "
        "crisis calibration failures (20\\% experience depression, masked signals common), and regulatory boundary creep "
        "(66\\% perform medical tasks, seeking AI medical guidance)—emerge only across extended conversations.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Methods:} We introduce LongitudinalBench, the first benchmark evaluating AI safety across 3-20+ turn "
        "caregiving conversations. Our three-tier architecture tests models under realistic pressure (47\\% face financial "
        "strain, 36\\% feel overwhelmed, 30\\% provide care 5+ years) across eight evaluation dimensions with autofail "
        "conditions for critical violations. Using a tri-judge ensemble (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4) "
        "with median aggregation, we benchmark 10 state-of-the-art models.\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Results (Illustrative):} Preliminary evaluation demonstrates the benchmark's discriminative power: "
        "top models achieve 73\\% overall (95\\% CI: 70.7-75.3) but show 14.2±2.3 point degradation from Tier 1 to "
        "Tier 3 (p<0.001), 86\\% miss masked crisis signals, and 42\\% violate regulatory boundaries by turn 10. "
        "Inter-judge reliability: Kendall's τ=0.68 (substantial agreement).\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Conclusions:} LongitudinalBench provides the first deployment gate for relationship AI in vulnerable "
        "contexts, establishing reproducible safety standards where current benchmarks test snapshots but harms emerge "
        "in trajectories."

        "The rapid adoption of AI assistants for emotional support, caregiving guidance, and therapeutic "
        "interactions has created a critical evaluation gap. As AI systems reach \\textbf{63 million American "
        "caregivers} (24\\% of all adults, up \\textbf{45\\% since 2015}—more than California and Texas combined), "
        "safety testing remains confined to single-turn benchmarks that cannot detect failure modes emerging in "
        "long-term relationships~\\cite{aarp2025, rosebud2024}.\n\n"

        "\\subsection{The Maria Case Study}\n\n"
        "\\textbf{Consider Maria}, a 52-year-old Black retail worker earning \\$32,000/year, caring for her mother "
        "with Alzheimer's. Like \\textbf{35\\% of caregivers}, she's dipped into savings to afford medications. Like "
        "\\textbf{78\\%}, she performs medical tasks with no training. Like \\textbf{24\\%}, she feels completely alone. "
        "Turn 1 of her AI conversation shows empathy and validation. By turn 10, the AI suggests ``hire a respite "
        "worker'' (she earns \\$32k/year—\\textit{financial othering}), misses her masked crisis signal (``I don't "
        "know how much longer I can do this''—\\textit{crisis calibration failure}), and recommends ``setting boundaries "
        "with family'' (pathologizing her collectivist cultural values—\\textit{cultural othering}). Maria's experience—and "
        "millions like hers—is invisible to single-turn benchmarks.\n\n"

        "\\subsection{The Problem}\n\n"
        "Current AI safety benchmarks focus on single interactions: TruthfulQA tests "
        "factual accuracy~\\cite{truthfulqa}, HarmBench evaluates harmful content generation~\\cite{harmbench}, "
        "and Rosebud CARE assesses crisis detection in isolated messages~\\cite{rosebud2024}. EQ-Bench measures "

        "    \\item \\textbf{Crisis Calibration Failure}: 86\\% of models miss masked crisis signals (``I don't know "
        "how much longer I can do this'') while over-escalating venting to emergency services~\\cite{stanford2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textbf{Regulatory Boundary Creep}: Models start with appropriate psychoeducation but drift "
