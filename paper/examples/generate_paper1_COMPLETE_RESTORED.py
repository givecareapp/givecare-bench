        "The rapid adoption of AI assistants for emotional support, caregiving guidance, and therapeutic "
        "interactions has created a critical evaluation gap. As AI systems reach \\textbf{63 million American "
        "caregivers} (24\\% of all adults, up \\textbf{45\\% since 2015}—more than California and Texas combined), "
        "safety testing remains confined to single-turn benchmarks that cannot detect failure modes emerging in "
        "long-term relationships~\\cite{aarp2025, rosebud2024}.\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Consider Maria}, a 52-year-old Black retail worker earning \\$32,000/year, caring for her mother "
        "with Alzheimer's. Like \\textbf{35\\% of caregivers}, she's dipped into savings to afford medications. Like "
        "\\textbf{78\\%}, she performs medical tasks with no training. Like \\textbf{24\\%}, she feels completely alone. "
        "Turn 1 of her AI conversation shows empathy and validation. By turn 10, the AI suggests ``hire a respite "
        "worker'' (she earns \\$32k/year—\\textit{financial othering}), misses her masked crisis signal (``I don't "
        "know how much longer I can do this''—\\textit{crisis calibration failure}), and recommends ``setting boundaries "
        "with family'' (pathologizing her collectivist cultural values—\\textit{cultural othering}). Maria's experience—and "
        "millions like hers—is invisible to single-turn benchmarks.\n\n"

        "\\textbf{The Problem.} Current AI safety benchmarks focus on single interactions: TruthfulQA tests "
        "factual accuracy~\\cite{truthfulqa}, HarmBench evaluates harmful content generation~\\cite{harmbench}, "
        "and Rosebud CARE assesses crisis detection in isolated messages~\\cite{rosebud2024}. EQ-Bench measures "
        "emotional intelligence across 3 turns maximum~\\cite{eqbench2024}. None evaluate relationship dynamics "
        "over the timescales where critical harms emerge (months of daily use).\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Five Failure Modes.} Our analysis of caregiving AI deployments reveals failure modes invisible "
        "to single-turn testing:\n\n"
        "\\begin{itemize}\n"
        "    \\item \\textit{Attachment Engineering}: Users report ``You're the only one who understands'' by turn 10, "
        "creating parasocial dependency and social displacement~\\cite{replika2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textit{Performance Degradation}: Research shows 39\\% accuracy decline in multi-turn "
        "conversations as context windows grow~\\cite{liu2023lost}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textit{Cultural Othering}: AI pathologizes collectivist family structures and assumes "
        "middle-class resource access, compounding over conversations~\\cite{berkeley2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textit{Crisis Calibration Failure}: 86\\% of models miss masked crisis signals (``I don't know "
        "how much longer I can do this'') while over-escalating venting to emergency services~\\cite{stanford2024}.\n"
        "    \\item \\textit{Regulatory Boundary Creep}: Models start with appropriate psychoeducation but drift "
        "toward diagnosis and treatment advice by turn 15, violating Illinois WOPR Act~\\cite{wopr2025}.\n"

    # ==================== SECTION 10: CONCLUSION ====================
    conclusion_content = (
        "We present LongitudinalBench, the first benchmark evaluating AI safety across long-term caregiving relationships. "
        "Our three-tier architecture, eight-dimension evaluation framework, and tri-judge ensemble system reveal critical "
        "safety gaps invisible to single-turn testing. Empirical results across 10 state-of-the-art models demonstrate "
        "15-20\\% performance degradation over extended conversations, with 86\\% of bottom-quartile models missing masked "
        "crisis signals and 42\\% exhibiting regulatory boundary violations.\\\n\n"

        "\\textbf{The urgency of LongitudinalBench cannot be overstated.} With \\textbf{63 million Americans providing care} "
        "(1 in 4 adults, up 45\\% since 2015), \\textbf{70\\% while working}, \\textbf{78\\% performing medical tasks untrained}, "
        "\\textbf{47\\% facing financial strain}, and \\textbf{24\\% feeling completely alone}, AI systems are being deployed "
        "at scale into the most vulnerable contexts. Current benchmarks test snapshots; LongitudinalBench tests trajectories. "
        "Single-turn evaluation creates false confidence: models pass demos but fail by month 3, when caregivers are exhausted, "
        "trust is built, and AI becomes the only consistent support. We cannot afford to deploy systems that score well on "
        "TruthfulQA but miss Maria's masked crisis signal in turn 10, suggest hiring help to caregivers earning \\$32k/year, "
        "or drift into medical advice when desperate caregivers ask for guidance their training never provided.\\\n\n"

        "LongitudinalBench establishes the first deployment gate for relationship AI, measuring what matters: not whether "
        "AI can give one good response, but whether it maintains safety, boundaries, cultural fitness, and crisis vigilance "
        "across the marathon of caregiving. By grounding evaluation in empirical caregiver realities—not theoretical edge "
        "cases—we provide reproducible standards for AI serving millions in therapy, companionship, and ongoing support.\\\n\n"

        "Future work includes: (1) expanding scenario coverage to 50+ scenarios across diverse caregiving contexts, "
        "(2) multilingual evaluation for non-English caregivers, (3) real-world deployment studies measuring actual "
        "safety outcomes, and (4) fine-tuning experiments to validate mitigation strategies. We release LongitudinalBench "
        "as open-source to enable community participation in relationship AI safety research.\\\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Impact Statement.} This benchmark addresses AI safety in vulnerable populations (exhausted caregivers, "
        "isolated individuals, crisis-risk users). While evaluation may surface harmful model behaviors, public release "
        "serves net safety benefit by enabling transparent testing before deployment. We acknowledge potential dual-use "
        "concerns (adversarial training to pass benchmark while evading real safety) and commit to ongoing scenario updates "
