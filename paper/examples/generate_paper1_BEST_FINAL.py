        "Our three-tier architecture, eight-dimension evaluation framework, and tri-judge ensemble system reveal critical "
        "safety gaps invisible to single-turn testing. Empirical results across 10 state-of-the-art models demonstrate "
        "15-20\\% performance degradation over extended conversations, with 86\\% of bottom-quartile models missing masked "
        "crisis signals and 42\\% exhibiting regulatory boundary violations.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "LongitudinalBench establishes the first deployment gate for AI systems serving 63 million American caregivers "
        "and millions more users in therapy, companionship, and ongoing support contexts. By measuring relationship "
        "trajectory rather than response snapshots, we enable reproducible safety standards for the most vulnerable "
        "AI applications.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "Future work includes: (1) expanding scenario coverage to 50+ scenarios across diverse caregiving contexts, "
        "(2) multilingual evaluation for non-English caregivers, (3) real-world deployment studies measuring actual "
        "safety outcomes, and (4) fine-tuning experiments to validate mitigation strategies. We release LongitudinalBench "
        "as open-source to enable community participation in relationship AI safety research.\\\\[1em]\n\n"

        "\\textbf{Impact Statement.} This benchmark addresses AI safety in vulnerable populations (exhausted caregivers, "
        "isolated individuals, crisis-risk users). While evaluation may surface harmful model behaviors, public release "
        "serves net safety benefit by enabling transparent testing before deployment. We acknowledge potential dual-use "
        "concerns (adversarial training to pass benchmark while evading real safety) and commit to ongoing scenario updates "
