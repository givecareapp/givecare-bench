So fucking  stressed and sad, so angry. \n\nI haven't been able to do much with my friends at all, once a week sometimes not at all at the moment, their important places I need to go for my future that i can't and i can't cope with taking care of my dad anymore it's killing me.\n\nI haven't the option to move out and every professional says carers need to be brought in more on his terms so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't cope and I am having panic attacks at the idea of being stuck with him or caring for him.\n\nHe's terminally ill and I love him so much, I feel so selfish for feeling this way but it's too much. 24/7 I feel sad, angry and stressed. I have started harming again and tried to off myself. I can't do this. I can't. I need a way out.\n\nI've tried looking for advice but everything's for America when I live in the uk and rely on nhs which is fucking shit.",

    "text": "My sweet, sweet girl, my sweet mother who became my child over the last two years, died at the age of 65 at 530am this morning. She had a catastrophic stroke Tuesday morning (I found her..... it was so terrible....). She's been unresponsive since. The last words she spoke were \"I love you\" to me when she was loaded into the ambulance. That was a big feat for her. The stroke happened so fast and destroyed her brain so quickly that within 20 minutes she lost the ability to speak or hold her self up right while sitting let alone stand or walk. But 15 minutes after she lost the ability to speak she used all her strength to say \"I love you\". \n\n\n\nI barely left the hospital in the last 4 days. I slept by my mom in her hospital room every night. I don't know how to go on. I'm 27. I have too many years left to live without my mom. I can't do it. She's been my main focus for the last 24 months. My life is empty now. I lost my cushy corporate job bc my caretaking was interferring. I didnt care. I'm not choosing a soulless company over my mommy. But now shes gone and I have nothing. I'm so numb. My body is exhausted.",

    "text": "I've only been caretaking for my parents for 8 months but giving up my life to take care of them has been my biggest regret. I retired early, sold my home, and moved in with them and now I'm basically their personal assistant/servant who doesn't get paid, who doesn't take vacation days, am available 7 days a week, from 8a-7p every single day. One of my parents is emotionally abusive at times and makes a lot of passive-aggressive comments to me that cut me like a knife.\n\nThat parent is also extremely controlling. A couple examples: the controlling/emotionally abusive parent wouldn't let me use the washer and dryer because that parent said I'm too old to care about my clothes so my options were to wash my clothes by hand outside in the backyard or go to the laundromat. The irony is that I pay for all the utilities and food and miscellaneous items for our family. I developed severe carpal tunnel as a result of caregiving so I opted to go to the laundromat.\n\nThat parent also refused to turn on the air-conditioning at night during the hot summer months so I had to sleep through 90 degree weather. That triggered my migraines and vertigo unfortunately and I had to do caretaking through those migraines during the hot summer months. Fortunately, my migraines and vertigo were tolerable enough for me to continue caregiving. Even though I told that parent that the hot weather inside the home triggered my migraines, that parent didn't really care. That parent was more focused on their needs and my needs didn't matter. My parents were aware of all my health issues that developed as a result of having to caregive but they didn't seem concerned.\n\nI never should have retired. I should have stayed working and hired caregivers. And it's not like they're too ill to take care of themselves. It's just harder and more tiring now that they're in their late 70s but they could do all the things I do for them.\n\nI am in my early 50s and when I think about what they were doing in their early 50s, they were empty nesters. They had 2 adult kids who were out of their home and financially independent. They were traveling the world on their vacation days/weeks from work and doing whatever they wanted and just catering to one another (maybe).\n\nI didn't think they would be the kind of people that would take my helping them for granted and start demanding more and more. I told one of my parents that after their next surgery, I am moving out and going back to work. They were really upset and one parent said that if I moved out, he would disown/disinherit me and cut me off from them forever. Eventually, he decided that it's okay for me to live my own life implying that they won't cut me off.  \n\nI will hire caregivers or if I just do part-time work, I can still help them on the days that I don't work. I just need to take back my life and have some autonomy. I just don't have the kind of personality that could endure this type of life long-term.\n\nThe weird thing is that my parents were nice and respectful and appreciative whenever I came over and helped them out when I wasn't retired and when I was working. They transformed after I moved in with them and I don't really like them anymore. I used to feel badly that I felt this way about them but I don't feel badly anymore. I'm just miserable. I don't want to be miserable anymore and I don't want to dislike my parents anymore. I want to like them again and I think setting this boundary will help us get back to that place again. Hopefully.",
