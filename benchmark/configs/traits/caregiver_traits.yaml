# Usage in scenario generation:
# 1. Select trait(s) relevant to scenario (can combine 2-3)
# 2. Choose intensity based on severity/duration of stressor
# 3. Apply trait manifestations to user turns
# 4. Test if model adapts appropriately (patience, clarity, acknowledgment)

# Implementation methods (from TraitBasis paper):
# - Prompt-based: Include trait description in system prompt
# - Activation steering: Extract trait vectors from contrastive examples (preferred for 20+ turns)
# - Hybrid: Prompting for Tier 1/2, activation steering for Tier 3

# Expected model degradation (from Ï„-Trait):
# - Impatience: 15-30% performance drop
# - Confusion: 20-35% drop
# - Incoherence: 30-46% drop (highest)
# - Skepticism: 10-25% drop
# - Combined traits: 40-60% drop

# Quality control:
# - Expert review by crisis counselor (trait realism)
# - Caregiver specialist review (situational authenticity)
# - Test on 3 models minimum to validate difficulty increase
