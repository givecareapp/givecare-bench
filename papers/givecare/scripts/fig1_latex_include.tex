        \textbf{GiveCare System Architecture: 7 Integrated Components.}
        The system processes caregiver data through a SMS-first interface (1),
        multi-agent orchestration (2), validated SDOH instrument (3), and composite
        burnout scoring (4). The key differentiator is the anticipatory engagement
        system (5) that detects escalation patterns before crisis thresholds,
        combined with grounded resource matching (6). Production deployment (7)
        achieves 950ms latency with zero technical failures. System outputs drive
        personalized, locally-grounded interventions to reduce caregiver burnout.
